# Vulnerability Management

## Scan Frequency

### Risk Appetite

Risk appetite plays a crucial role in determining scan frequency. Organizations should review their risk appetite at least annually, or when there are significant changes in strategy or the risk landscape. A more conservative risk appetite may necessitate more frequent scans, while a more expansionary approach might allow for less frequent scanning.

### Regulatory Requirements

Different industries have specific regulatory requirements that dictate scan frequency:

- PCI DSS requires vulnerability scans at least quarterly and after any significant network changes.
- HIPAA mandates regular risk assessments but doesn't specify an exact frequency.
- NIST SP 800-53 recommends monthly scans and after significant system changes.

### Technical Constraints

Technical factors affecting scan frequency include:

- Network performance: Scans can impact network speed and should be scheduled during off-peak hours.
- System complexity: Larger or more complex networks may require more time between scans to process results effectively.
- Adaptive algorithms: Some scanning tools adjust their speed based on network conditions to maintain accuracy.

### Business Constraints

Business factors to consider include:

- Operational impact: Scans should be scheduled to minimize disruption to business operations.
- Resource availability: The frequency of scans may be limited by available personnel to conduct and analyze them.
- Continuous development: Businesses must balance the need for frequent scans with ongoing product or service development.

### Licensing Limitations

While not explicitly mentioned in the search results, licensing limitations can affect scan frequency. Organizations should consider:

- The number of scans allowed under their current licensing agreement.
- The cost of additional scans or expanded licensing if more frequent scanning is required.

In conclusion, determining the appropriate scan frequency requires balancing these factors to meet security needs while considering operational, regulatory, and resource constraints. Organizations should aim for at least quarterly scans as a baseline, with more frequent scans for critical systems or high-risk environments.
