Social engineering and password attacks are critical topics covered in the CompTIA Security+ exam. These attack methods exploit human behavior and technical vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to systems and data.

## Social Engineering

Social engineering attacks manipulate people into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. Common techniques include:

1. Phishing: Attackers impersonate trusted entities to steal sensitive information, often through emails or fake websites.

2. Spear phishing: A targeted form of phishing aimed at specific individuals or groups.

3. Pretexting: Creating a fabricated scenario to obtain information, such as impersonating IT staff.

4. Shoulder surfing: Observing victims as they enter passwords or sensitive data.

Social engineers exploit psychological principles like authority, trust, and scarcity to increase their success rate. They may use multiple people or automated tools to carry out attacks.

## Password Attacks

Password attacks attempt to gain unauthorized access to accounts by guessing or cracking passwords. Common methods include:

1. Brute force attacks: Systematically trying every possible password combination.

2. Dictionary attacks: Using a list of common words to guess passwords more efficiently than brute force.

3. Password spraying: Attempting a small number of common passwords across many accounts to avoid lockouts.

4. Rainbow tables: Precomputed tables for reversing cryptographic hash functions, used to crack password hashes.

Attackers often perform offline attacks on stolen password hashes, allowing them to attempt many combinations quickly without triggering account lockouts.

To defend against these attacks, the CompTIA Security+ exam emphasizes the importance of strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, account lockout policies, and user education on social engineering tactics.
